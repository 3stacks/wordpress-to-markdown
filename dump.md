Pretty ordinary.\n\nAs usual, I threw myself in the deep end without any proper planning and started plugging away, and eventually I decided that I needed to do away with the rows. If each slide is a scrollable canvas the content can be much more fleshed out.\n\nSo the idea became that each slide was inlined and their position would be translated depending on which slide you have selected.\n\n<a href=\"http://lukeboyle.com/wp/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/portfolio-1.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-205\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-205\" src=\"http://lukeboyle.com/wp/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/portfolio-1-1024x576.png\" alt=\"portfolio 1\" width=\"604\" height=\"340\" /></a>\n\nThe tricky part was that when you scrolled down and pressed next, you would be in the middle of the slide.

I'm hoping to figure out a more user friendly way of generating the slides and then I'll package it up and release it as a site plugin. The slide classes are applied using JavaScript so it has a nice no-js fallback where all the slides just stack naturally and you can scroll down.

So we decided to make one.\n\nNot being people to shy away from a challenge, we jumped right into it. On the first night we defined a template syntax using pipes <code>||| header |||</code>. Pypes has a function that processes your the view file, finds the <code>|||</code> and then searches for the file you defined inside it.\n\nThe only thing you need to do to make a new partial is make a php file in the partials folder and then reference it in the view. Super simple.\n\nWhile Bryce was working hard to make the RESTful API, I got to work on the admin panel (Pypes Face) which was built in Angular. The admin panel has the ability to view all posts, edit posts, create new posts and delete posts. Pypes Face has an API client for the basic http requests, and then the controllers use those functions with Promises to do things such as generating a permalink and checking if it is unique.

This should be transpiled to ES5 and output to the root directory called 'index.js'. In this instance, index.js is the \"main\" in your package.json.

After searching for hours, I can conclusively say that there is no open source solution for this, and given the constraints of the garbage liquid templating engine, I can confidently say that this is the least convoluted solution available.\n\nAll it takes is implementing a rigid structure in your tagging system, so this is much easier on a new store.\n\nThe tag structure is basically as such: category:tagName. Let's say you want to filter your products by brand. In your product page, on the tags section, enter brand:brandName. Same goes for <code>size:1</code> or <code>color:blue</code>. It's up to you how many you use, because I guarantee your collection sorting template is going to be a BIG file.\n\nThe best part about all this is that there's no array filter or equivalent method in liquid, so we're going to have to do some crazy shit.\n\n<pre>\n{% for tag in collection.all_tags %} <-- Start iterating over all tags\n  {% if tag contains 'style' %} <-- Check if it contains your keyword\n    {% capture raw_style_tags %} <-- Initialise the variable `raw_style_tags`\n      {{ raw_style_tags | append : tag | append: ', ' }} <-- Build a string of tags separated by commas\n    {% endcapture %}\n    {% assign style_tags = raw_style_tags | split: ', ' %} <-- Split the strings on the commas to build a new array\n  {% endif %}\n{% endfor %}\n</pre>\n\nThe variable <code>style_tags</code> is now an array of all tags including 'style:'. Now, you will make a select field where the options are all of your style tags. Note that current_tags returns a list of the tags you are currently filtering by.\n\n<pre>\n<label>\n  Shop by style\n  <select class=\"coll-filter\">\n    <option value=\"\">All</option>\n      {% for t in style_tags %}\n        {% assign tag = t | strip %}\n    {% if current_tags contains tag %} <-- check if the tag is currently active - applies selected attribute\n      <option value=\"{{ tag | handle }}\" selected>{{ tag | remove: 'style:' }}</option>\n    {% elsif product_tags contains tag %} <-- else, just make it an option\n      <option value=\"{{ tag | handle }}\">{{ tag | remove: 'style:' }}</option> <-- use the remove filter to have just the tag name\n    {% endif %}\n      {% endfor %}\n  </select>\n</label>\n</pre>\n\nIf you include the Javascript from the Shopify docs, it will automatically listen for changes to that .coll-filter. This way, if you ever add any more tags under the <code>style:</code> category, you won't have to update your view.\n\nAnd the best part is, you can just add a new category in your product page, copy paste those lines of code and change 'style' to whatever your new category is called.\n\nI must reiterate, you should only use Shopify if you have no other choice.\n\nCheers!","post_title":"Dynamic Product Filtering in Shopify","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"dynamic-product-filtering-shopify","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2016-08-11 00:37:34","post_modified_gmt":"2016-08-11 00:37:34","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http://lukeboyle.com/wp/blog/?p=286","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},"template":"\n            # Dynamic Product Filtering in Shopify\n            \n            Posted on 2016-08-11 00:37:34\n            \n            <pre class=\"disclaimer-block\">Disclaimer: Shopify is not good.

Note that current_tags returns a list of the tags you are currently filtering by.\n\n<pre> <label>Shop by style\n  <select class=\"coll-filter\"><option value=\"\">All</option>\n      {% for t in style_tags %}\n        {% assign tag = t | strip %}\n    {% if current_tags contains tag %} <-- check if the tag is currently active - applies selected attribute\n      <option value=\"{{ tag | handle }}\" selected=\"\">{{ tag | remove: 'style:' }}</option>\n    {% elsif product_tags contains tag %} <-- else, just make it an option\n      <option value=\"{{ tag | handle }}\">{{ tag | remove: 'style:' }}</option> <-- use the remove filter to have just the tag name\n    {% endif %}\n      {% endfor %}</select></label> \n</pre>\n\nIf you include the Javascript from the Shopify docs, it will automatically listen for changes to that .coll-filter. This way, if you ever add any more tags under the `style:` category, you won't have to update your view. And the best part is, you can just add a new category in your product page, copy paste those lines of code and change 'style' to whatever your new category is called. I must reiterate, you should only use Shopify if you have no other choice.

For another example of a good use case for recursion, see this article: [http://blog.javascriptroom.com/2013/01/10/fibonacci-an-introduction-to-recursion/](http://blog.javascriptroom.com/2013/01/10/fibonacci-an-introduction-to-recursion/).\n        "},{"post":{"ID":"364","post_author":"1","post_date":"2016-09-27 05:48:32","post_date_gmt":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","post_content":"","post_title":"Using the fetch API","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"draft","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2016-09-27 05:48:32","post_modified_gmt":"2016-09-27 05:48:32","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http://lukeboyle.com/?p=364","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},"template":"\n            # Using the fetch API\n            \n            Posted on 2016-09-27 05:48:32\n            \n            \n        "},{"post":{"ID":"365","post_author":"1","post_date":"2016-09-27 05:48:32","post_date_gmt":"2016-09-27 05:48:32","post_content":"","post_title":"Using the fetch API","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"364-revision-v1","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2016-09-27 05:48:32","post_modified_gmt":"2016-09-27 05:48:32","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"364","guid":"http://lukeboyle.com/364-revision-v1/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},"template":"\n            # Using the fetch API\n            \n            Posted on 2016-09-27 05:48:32\n            \n            \n        "},{"post":{"ID":"367","post_author":"1","post_date":"2016-10-13 02:57:36","post_date_gmt":"2016-10-13 02:57:36","post_content":"A quick-start guide for running Karma tests for Chrome in Travis CI.\n\nWhen you run Travis on a Node.js project, Travis will - by default - run <code>npm install</code> and then <code>npm test</code>.

You define your browser breakpoints, the pages, and the parts of the pages you wish to capture.\n\nAll <code>components</code> are defined with a name and a selector. For example, \".site-nav\" or \"body\". You define all components in the components array, but then you can cherry pick which ones are used on each page.

You define your browser breakpoints, the pages, and the parts of the pages you wish to capture.\n\nAll <code>components</code> are defined with a name and a selector. For example, \".site-nav\" or \"body\". You define all components in the components array, but then you can cherry pick which ones are used on each page. Such as, homepage may use the hero component, but about may not.\n\n<pre><code class=\"javascript\">{\n  \"sizes\": [ \"320x480\", \"1280x768\", \"1920x1080\" ],\n  \"pages\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"homepage\",\n      \"url\": \"http://localhost:3000/\",\n      \"components\": [ \"hero\", \"all\" ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"components\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"all\",\n      \"selector\": \"body\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"hero\",\n      \"selector\": \".hero\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</code></pre>\n\nSince I'm generally against installing npm packages globally (and you probably should be <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/solve-global-npm-module-dependency-problem/\">too</a>), I define my capture scripts in <code>package.json</code>.\n\nThis presents the first issue:\n\nThe usage of Argus is like so: <code>argus-eyes capture &lt;branch-name&gt;</code>\n\nBut this of course only names the capture for you. It's your responsibility to switch branches.\n\nSo the workflow becomes:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Clone <code>develop</code> branch</li>\n<li>run <code>argus-eyes capture develop</code> (this is the baseline)</li>\n<li>Clone <code>feature-branch-name</code></li>\n<li>run <code>argus-eyes capture feature-branch-name</code></li>\n<li>run <code>argus-eyes compare develop feature-branch-name</code></li>\n</ul>\n\nArgus then uses blink-diff to compare the two sets of screenshots you just captured (note, you shouldn't change your config between captures) and outputs any screenshots in which there are visual differences.\n\nFor example, bumping the padding on your nav will result in something like this.\n\n<img src=\"http://lukeboyle.com/app/uploads/2016/12/nav.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" alt=\"nav\" width=\"1228\" height=\"111\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-384\" />\n\nIt's not a super intelligent representation, however, it does quickly show you that something is wrong.\n\nIn my opinion, the current workflow makes it almost worth not bothering. So how do we make it a 1 step test?\n\n<h2>Automation</h2>\n\nI am attempting to simulate this entire process in node. For this, we'll need a few things.\n\n<ul>\n<li>The ability to use git functions in node (http://www.nodegit.org/)</li>\n<li>The ability to execute console commands in node (for this, I am using <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/shelljs\" target=\"_blank\">shelljs</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n\nI've tried to make the node script as pure as possible.

Once we've refactored all of those individual functions, the main input validation function looks like this:\n\n<pre><code>function validateFormInputs(event) {\n\n    let isFormValid = true;\n    const phoneNumberFeedback = document.getElementById(\"PhoneValidation\");\n\n    if (isPhoneNumberValid()) {\n        phoneNumberFeedback.innerHTML = '';\n    } else {\n        phoneNumberFeedback.innterHTML = \"Only numbers, '-' and '+' characters are accepted\";\n        isFormValid = false;\n    }\n\n    if (isFormValid) {\n        contactForm.removeEventListener('submit', validateFormInputs);\n        return true;\n    } else {\n        event.preventDefault();\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\nIt's cleaner, sure, but I'm still not okay with using and mutating that <code>isFormValid</code> variable and <code>innerHTML</code> appearing every other line.

To do this, I'm going to bundle all the validation methods into an object and then reduce that to return an isFormValid bool.\n\n<pre><code>const fields = {\n  phoneNumber: {\n    isFieldValid: function() {\n      const phoneNumber = document.getElementsByName(\"Phone\")[0].value;\n      const phoneNumberRegex = /^[0-9\\s\\-\\+]{6,14}$/g;\n      return phoneNumberRegex.test(phoneNumber);\n    },\n    userFeedbackElement: document.getElementById(\"PhoneValidation\"),\n    errorMessage: \"Only numbers, '-' and '+' characters are accepted\"\n  }\n};\n\n// Generate an array from the keys of the methods object and reduce\nObject.keys(validationMethods).reduce((acc, curr) =&gt; {\n    // do stuff\n}, true);\n</code></pre>\n\nIf you're not familiar with <code>Array.reduce</code>, it will iterate over each item in the array and allow you to process them. The arguments are <code>acc</code> (accumulative) and <code>curr</code> (current). The idea is, we're going to execute each function and then show/hide error messages accordingly.\n\nThe function now looks like this:\n\n<pre><code>function validateFormInputs(event) {\n\n  const isFormValid = Object.keys(fields).reduce((acc, curr) =&gt; {\n    const currentField = fields[curr];\n\n    if (currentField.isFieldValid()) {\n      generateErrorMessage(currentField.userFeedbackElement, '');\n      return acc;\n    } else {\n      generateErrorMessage(currentField.userFeedbackElement, currentField.errorMessage);\n      return false;\n    }\n  }, true);\n\n  if (isFormValid) {\n    contactForm.removeEventListener('submit', validateFormInputs);\n    return true;\n    } else {\n      event.preventDefault();\n  }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\nThis implementation is clearly a case-by-case basis. It works for my particular scenario because there's only one validation condition for each field. If there were more rules, the approach would need to be changed to compensate and it may not be able to be as dynamic.\n\nIt should also be noted that this is a fairly over-engineered solution.

Once we've refactored all of those individual functions, the main input validation function looks like this:\n\n    function validateFormInputs(event) {\n\n        let isFormValid = true;\n        const firstNameFeedback = document.getElementById(\"FnameValidation\");\n        const phoneNumberFeedback = document.getElementById(\"PhoneValidation\");\n\n        if (isFirstNameValid()) {\n            firstNameFeedback.innerHTML = \"\";\n        } else {\n            firstNameFeedback.innerHTML = \"Cannot be empty\";\n            isFormValid = false;\n        }\n\n        if (isPhoneNumberValid()) {\n            phoneNumberFeedback.innerHTML = '';\n        } else {\n            phoneNumberFeedback.innterHTML = \"Only numbers, '-' and '+' characters are accepted\";\n            isFormValid = false;\n        }\n\n        if (isFormValid) {\n            contactForm.removeEventListener('submit', validateFormInputs);\n            return true;\n        } else {\n            event.preventDefault();\n        }\n\n    }\n\nIt's cleaner, sure, but I'm still not okay with using and mutating that `isFormValid` variable and `innerHTML` appearing every other line.

An excerpt of the script can be seen below, and this documents the process I took when reviving the JS side of things.\n\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\n      var flagValidation;\n\n      /* validation for 'FirstName' */\n      function FirstNameValidation() {\n        if (document.getElementsByName(\"First_Name\")[0].value == \"\") {\n          flagValidation = false;\n          document.getElementById(\"FnameValidation\").innerHTML = \"Cannot be empty\"\n        }\n        else\n          document.getElementById(\"FnameValidation\").innerHTML = \"\"\n      }\n\n      /* validation for 'phone number' */\n      function PhoneNumberValidation() {\n        var phoneNum = document.getElementsByName(\"Phone\")[0].value;\n        var normalPhonepattern = /^[0-9\\s\\-\\+]{6,14}$/g;\n\n        if(!normalPhonepattern.test(phoneNum))\n        {\n          flagValidation = false;\n          document.getElementById(\"PhoneValidation\").innerHTML = \"Only numbers, '-' and '+' characters are accepted\"\n        }\n        else\n          document.getElementById(\"PhoneValidation\").innerHTML = \"\"\n      }\n\n      function SubmitDetails(){\n        flagValidation = true;\n\n        FirstNameValidation();\n        PhoneNumberValidation();\n\n        return flagValidation;\n      }\n\n    </script>\n\nSo what is wrong with this picture? - There's no reason for this to be a script tag on the page, let's make it an external script - Mutation - Basing the validation on mutating the variable to false should not be the responsibility of these function - The functions are doing too much, they should just be returning a bool, and a validate function can follow up. - Repeating code (e.g. `document.getElement...`) unnecessarily When you allow your functions to be purely functional, this function...\n\n      function PhoneNumberValidation() {\n        var phoneNum = document.getElementsByName(\"Phone\")[0].value;\n        var normalPhonepattern = /^[0-9\\s\\-\\+]{6,14}$/g;\n\n        if(!normalPhonepattern.test(phoneNum))\n        {\n          flagValidation = false;\n          document.getElementById(\"PhoneValidation\").innerHTML = \"Only numbers, '-' and '+' characters are accepted\"\n        }\n        else\n          document.getElementById(\"PhoneValidation\").innerHTML = \"\"\n      }\n\nCan become...\n\n    function isPhoneNumberValid() {\n      const phoneNumber = document.getElementsByName(\"Phone\")[0].value;\n      const phoneNumberRegex = /^[0-9\\s\\-\\+]{6,14}$/g;\n      return phoneNumberRegex.test(phoneNumber);\n    }\n\nMuch prettier, right? Once we've refactored all of those individual functions, the main input validation function looks like this:\n\n    function validateFormInputs(event) {\n\n        let isFormValid = true;\n        const firstNameFeedback = document.getElementById(\"FnameValidation\");\n        const phoneNumberFeedback = document.getElementById(\"PhoneValidation\");\n\n        if (isFirstNameValid()) {\n            firstNameFeedback.innerHTML = \"\";\n        } else {\n            firstNameFeedback.innerHTML = \"Cannot be empty\";\n            isFormValid = false;\n        }\n\n        if (isPhoneNumberValid()) {\n            phoneNumberFeedback.innerHTML = '';\n        } else {\n            phoneNumberFeedback.innterHTML = \"Only numbers, '-' and '+' characters are accepted\";\n            isFormValid = false;\n        }\n\n        if (isFormValid) {\n            contactForm.removeEventListener('submit', validateFormInputs);\n            return true;\n        } else {\n            event.preventDefault();\n        }\n\n    }\n\nIt's cleaner, sure, but I'm still not okay with using and mutating that `isFormValid` variable and `innerHTML` appearing every other line. Let's take it further. Let's outsource the error message work to a utility function.\n\n    function generateErrorMessage(element, message) {\n      return element.innerHTML = message;\n    }\n\n    // So we use that like this...\n\n    if (isFirstNameValid()) {\n      generateErrorMessage(firstNameFeedback, '');\n    } else {\n      generateErrorMessage(firstNameFeedback, 'Cannot be empty');\n      isFormValid = false;\n    }\n\nThe next step is to stop mutating that validity flag. To do this, I'm going to bundle all the validation methods into an object.\n\n    const fields = {\n      firstName: {\n        isFieldValid: function() {\n          const firstName = document.getElementsByName(\"First_Name\")[0].value;\n          return firstName !== '';\n        },\n        userFeedbackElement: document.getElementById(\"FnameValidation\"),\n        errorMessage: 'Cannot be empty'\n      },\n      phoneNumber: {\n        isFieldValid: function() {\n          const phoneNumber = document.getElementsByName(\"Phone\")[0].value;\n          const phoneNumberRegex = /^[0-9\\s\\-\\+]{6,14}$/g;\n          return phoneNumberRegex.test(phoneNumber);\n        },\n        userFeedbackElement: document.getElementById(\"PhoneValidation\"),\n        errorMessage: \"Only numbers, '-' and '+' characters are accepted\"\n      }\n    };\n\n    // Generate an array from the keys of the methods object and reduce\n    Object.keys(validationMethods).reduce((acc, curr) => {\n        // do stuff\n    }, true);\n\nIf you're not familiar with `Array.reduce`, it will iterate over each item in the array and allow you to process them. The arguments are `acc` (accumulative) and `curr` (current). The idea is, we're going to execute each function and then show/hide error messages accordingly. The function now looks like this:\n\n    function validateFormInputs(event) {\n\n      const isFormValid = Object.keys(fields).reduce((acc, curr) => {\n        const currentField = fields[curr];\n\n        if (currentField.isFieldValid()) {\n          generateErrorMessage(currentField.userFeedbackElement, '');\n          return acc;\n        } else {\n          generateErrorMessage(currentField.userFeedbackElement, currentField.errorMessage);\n          return false;\n        }\n      }, true);\n\n      if (isFormValid) {\n        contactForm.removeEventListener('submit', validateFormInputs);\n        return true;\n        } else {\n          event.preventDefault();\n      }\n\n    }\n\nThis implementation is clearly a case-by-case basis. It works for my particular scenario because there's only one validation condition for each field. If there were more rules, the approach would need to be changed to compensate and it may not be able to be as dynamic. It should also be noted that this is a fairly over-engineered solution.

The idea is, we're going to execute each function and then show/hide error messages accordingly.\n\nThe function now looks like this:\n\n<pre><code>function validateFormInputs(event) {\n\n  const isFormValid = Object.keys(fields).reduce((acc, curr) =&gt; {\n    const currentField = fields[curr];\n\n    if (currentField.isFieldValid()) {\n      generateErrorMessage(currentField.userFeedbackElement, '');\n      return acc;\n    } else {\n      generateErrorMessage(currentField.userFeedbackElement, currentField.errorMessage);\n      return false;\n    }\n  }, true);\n\n  if (isFormValid) {\n    contactForm.removeEventListener('submit', validateFormInputs);\n    return true;\n    } else {\n      event.preventDefault();\n  }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\nThis implementation is clearly a case-by-case basis. It works for my particular scenario because there's only one validation condition for each field. If there were more rules, the approach would need to be changed to compensate and it may not be able to be as dynamic.\n\nIt should also be noted that this is a fairly over-engineered solution. I wouldn't say that the original approach is <em>wrong</em>, but my approach looks at the same problem from a functional programming standpoint.\n\nFor a view of the entire file, see my gist at <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/3stacks/c5c49904684e4ddec48aa017ab912db9\">https://gist.github.com/3stacks/c5c49904684e4ddec48aa017ab912db9</a>","post_title":"Functional Form Validation in JavaScript (aka: Inheriting bad JavaScript)","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"427-revision-v1","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2017-01-30 01:45:50","post_modified_gmt":"2017-01-30 01:45:50","post_content_filtered":"I was recently given the job of rebuilding a particularly bad landing page from an external company.

When looking at it from a functional standpoint, they should just be returning a bool, and a final validate function can follow up.\r\n- Repeating code (e.g. `document.getElement...`) unnecessarily\r\n\r\nWhen you allow your functions to be purely functional, this function...\r\n\r\n```\r\n  function PhoneNumberValidation() {\r\n    var phoneNum = document.getElementsByName(&quot;Phone&quot;)[0].value;\r\n    var normalPhonepattern = /^[0-9\\s\\-\\+]{6,14}$/g;\r\n\r\n    if(!normalPhonepattern.test(phoneNum))\r\n    {\r\n      flagValidation = false;\r\n      document.getElementById(&quot;PhoneValidation&quot;).innerHTML = &quot;Only numbers, &#039;-&#039; and &#039;+&#039; characters are accepted&quot;\r\n    }\r\n    else\r\n      document.getElementById(&quot;PhoneValidation&quot;).innerHTML = &quot;&quot;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nCan become...\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction isPhoneNumberValid() {\r\n  const phoneNumber = document.getElementsByName(&quot;Phone&quot;)[0].value;\r\n  const phoneNumberRegex = /^[0-9\\s\\-\\+]{6,14}$/g;\r\n  return phoneNumberRegex.test(phoneNumber);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMuch prettier, right? Once we've refactored all of those individual functions, the main input validation function looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction validateFormInputs(event) {\r\n\r\n\tlet isFormValid = true;\r\n\tconst phoneNumberFeedback = document.getElementById(&quot;PhoneValidation&quot;);\r\n\r\n\tif (isPhoneNumberValid()) {\r\n\t\tphoneNumberFeedback.innerHTML = &#039;&#039;;\r\n\t} else {\r\n\t\tphoneNumberFeedback.innterHTML = &quot;Only numbers, &#039;-&#039; and &#039;+&#039; characters are accepted&quot;;\r\n\t\tisFormValid = false;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tif (isFormValid) {\r\n\t\tcontactForm.removeEventListener(&#039;submit&#039;, validateFormInputs);\r\n\t\treturn true;\r\n\t} else {\r\n\t\tevent.preventDefault();\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's cleaner, sure, but I'm still not okay with using and mutating that `isFormValid` variable and `innerHTML` appearing every other line. Let's take it further.\r\n\r\nLet's outsource the error message work to a utility function.\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction generateErrorMessage(element, message) {\r\n  return element.innerHTML = message;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// So we use that like this...\r\n\r\nif (isPhoneNumberValid()) {\r\n  generateErrorMessage(phoneNumberFeedback, &#039;&#039;);\r\n} else {\r\n  generateErrorMessage(phoneNumberFeedback, &#039;Cannot be empty&#039;);\r\n  isFormValid = false;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe next step is to stop mutating that validity flag. To do this, I'm going to bundle all the validation methods into an object and then reduce that to return an isFormValid bool.\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst fields = {\r\n  phoneNumber: {\r\n    isFieldValid: function() {\r\n      const phoneNumber = document.getElementsByName(&quot;Phone&quot;)[0].value;\r\n      const phoneNumberRegex = /^[0-9\\s\\-\\+]{6,14}$/g;\r\n      return phoneNumberRegex.test(phoneNumber);\r\n    },\r\n    userFeedbackElement: document.getElementById(&quot;PhoneValidation&quot;),\r\n    errorMessage: &quot;Only numbers, &#039;-&#039; and &#039;+&#039; characters are accepted&quot;\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n\r\n// Generate an array from the keys of the methods object and reduce\r\nObject.keys(validationMethods).reduce((acc, curr) =&gt; {\r\n    // do stuff\r\n}, true);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're not familiar with `Array.reduce`, it will iterate over each item in the array and allow you to process them. The arguments are `acc` (accumulative) and `curr` (current). The idea is, we're going to execute each function and then show/hide error messages accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe function now looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction validateFormInputs(event) {\r\n\r\n  const isFormValid = Object.keys(fields).reduce((acc, curr) =&gt; {\r\n    const currentField = fields[curr];\r\n\r\n    if (currentField.isFieldValid()) {\r\n      generateErrorMessage(currentField.userFeedbackElement, &#039;&#039;);\r\n      return acc;\r\n    } else {\r\n      generateErrorMessage(currentField.userFeedbackElement, currentField.errorMessage);\r\n      return false;\r\n    }\r\n  }, true);\r\n\r\n  if (isFormValid) {\r\n    contactForm.removeEventListener(&#039;submit&#039;, validateFormInputs);\r\n    return true;\r\n    } else {\r\n      event.preventDefault();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis implementation is clearly a case-by-case basis. It works for my particular scenario because there's only one validation condition for each field. If there were more rules, the approach would need to be changed to compensate and it may not be able to be as dynamic.\r\n\r\nIt should also be noted that this is a fairly over-engineered solution. I wouldn't say that the original approach is *wrong*, but my approach looks at the same problem from a functional programming standpoint and I believe it is much cleaner and much more robust.\r\n\r\nFor a view of the entire file, see my gist at [https://gist.github.com/3stacks/c5c49904684e4ddec48aa017ab912db9](https://gist.github.com/3stacks/c5c49904684e4ddec48aa017ab912db9)","post_parent":"427","guid":"http://lukeboyle.com/427-revision-v1/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},"template":"\n            # Functional Form Validation in JavaScript (aka: Inheriting bad JavaScript)\n            \n            Posted on 2017-01-30 01:46:32\n            \n            I was recently given the job of rebuilding a particularly bad landing page from an external company.

The problem with typography, is that glyphs can have descenders (as in y and j) which push the bottom of the bounds down. This is shown in the second example above, where the button with descenders has equal padding top and bottom. If you want to properly vertically center your text you have to baby the padding so much that it becomes too much of a pain in the ass. The padding on the above buttons is <code>padding: 1rem 2rem 1.0625rem 2rem;</code>.  5 significant figures for bottom padding? I don't think so.\n\n<h2>Option 2: Line Height for vertical centering (Red Pill)</h2>\n\n<style>\n.button-lineheight-approach {\n    -webkit-appearance: none;\n    border-radius: 0;\n    border-style: solid;\n    border-width: 0;\n    cursor: pointer;\n    font-weight: normal;\n    line-height: normal;\n    margin: 0;\n    position: relative;\n    text-align: center;\n    text-decoration: none;\n    display: inline-block;\n    font-size: 16px;\n    background-color: #999;\n    color: #000;\n    max-width: 170px;\n    height: 50px;\n    line-height: 50px;\n    padding: 0 2rem 0;\n}\n</style>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"#\" class=\"button-lineheight-approach\">A Button</a>\n\n<a href=\"#\" class=\"button-lineheight-approach\">A Button that breaks to two lines</a>\n</div>\n\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/3stacks/8c705d6b88624d5e164355067c4fd0f7.js\"></script>\n\nThis approach is a lot less hands on for the vertical alignment. You set <code>height: 50px;</code> and <code>line-height: 50px;</code> and voila, perfect vertical alignment. Until you need two lines and then it bleeds out of the button because you thought a CTA would never be more than 3 words long. At this point you're forced to either increase the button width, or reduce your font-size and neither are very designer friendly.\n\n<h2>Option 3: Flexbox (the secret green pill)</h2>\n\n<img src=\"http://lukeboyle.com/app/uploads/2017/03/CCblInSUMAA8kxv.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"571\" height=\"565\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-479\" />\n\n<style>\n.button-flexbox-approach {\ndisplay: flex;\n  justify-content: center;\n  align-items: center;\n  -webkit-appearance: none;\n  border-radius: 0;\n  border-style: solid;\n  border-width: 0;\n  cursor: pointer;\n  font-weight: normal;\n  line-height: normal;\n  margin: 0 20px 0 0;\n  position: relative;\n  text-align: center;\n  text-decoration: none;\n  padding: 1.5rem 2rem;\n  font-size: 16px;\n  background-color: #34495e;\n  color: #fff;\n}\n.button-flexbox-approach:hover { color: #fff;}\n.flex-button-container {\n    display: inline-flex;\n}\n</style>\n\n<div class=\"flex-button-container\">\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"button-flexbox-approach\">A Button</a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"button-flexbox-approach\">A Button</a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"button-flexbox-approach\">asdf yjyj</a>\n</div>\n\n<br>\n\n<div class=\"flex-button-container\">\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"button-flexbox-approach\" style=\"max-width: 170px;\">A Button that breaks to two lines</a>\n</div>\n\n<br>\n\nNote that if you have varying heights, you may want to add `align-self` to the buttons so they retain their natural height (`align-self: center` in this example, flex-start to align to the top).\n\n<div class=\"flex-button-container\">\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"button-flexbox-approach\" style=\"align-self: center;\">A Button</a>\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"button-flexbox-approach\" style=\"max-width: 170px;\">A Button that breaks to two lines</a>\n</div>\n\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/3stacks/97e7a0d634f9f96cec1da05c109ff91e.js\"></script>\n\nThis approach just requires that your buttons have a container that is <code>display: inline-flex;</code>. Most people would have their buttons in a container anyway, as far as I can tell. Using inline-flex will let the buttons scale naturally and you can also apply flex properties (such as justify-content) to the buttons.\n\nThis approach is pretty bullet-proof from my testing and I like it a lot.","post_title":"CSS Buttons: Solved by Flexbox","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"css-buttons-solved-flexbox","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2017-03-09 04:41:32","post_modified_gmt":"2017-03-09 04:41:32","post_content_filtered":"There are two commonly accepted approaches to making buttons with CSS, but both of them are a little bit shit.\r\n\r\nWhat if I told you there was another way?

What if I told you there was another way? (`morpheus.wav`)\n\n## Option 1: Padding for vertical centering (Blue Pill)\n\n<style>.button-padding-approach { font-size: inherit; -webkit-appearance: none; border-radius: 0; border-style: solid; border-width: 0; cursor: pointer; font-weight: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0; position: relative; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; display: inline-block; padding: 1rem 2rem 1.0625rem 2rem; font-size: 16px; background-color: #999; color: #000; max-width: 170px; } .unbalanced { padding: 1rem 2rem !important; }</style>\n\n<div>[A Button](#) [asd yjy](#) [A Button that breaks to two lines](#)</div>\n\nThis approach works okay, and it's good for multi-line (buttons where the marketing team sanctioned too much copy) text. The problem with typography, is that glyphs can have descenders (as in y and j) which push the bottom of the bounds down. This is shown in the second example above, where the button with descenders has equal padding top and bottom. If you want to properly vertically center your text you have to baby the padding so much that it becomes too much of a pain in the ass. The padding on the above buttons is `padding: 1rem 2rem 1.0625rem 2rem;`. 5 significant figures for bottom padding? I don't think so.\n\n## Option 2: Line Height for vertical centering (Red Pill)\n\n<style>.button-lineheight-approach { -webkit-appearance: none; border-radius: 0; border-style: solid; border-width: 0; cursor: pointer; font-weight: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0; position: relative; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; display: inline-block; font-size: 16px; background-color: #999; color: #000; max-width: 170px; height: 50px; line-height: 50px; padding: 0 2rem 0; }</style>\n\n<div>[A Button](#) [A Button that breaks to two lines](#)</div>\n\nThis approach is a lot less hands on for the vertical alignment. You set `height: 50px;` and `line-height: 50px;` and voila, perfect vertical alignment. Until you need two lines and then it bleeds out of the button because you thought a CTA would never be more than 3 words long. At this point you're forced to either increase the button width, or reduce your font-size and neither are very designer friendly.\n\n## Option 3: Flexbox (the secret green pill)\n\n![](http://lukeboyle.com/app/uploads/2017/03/CCblInSUMAA8kxv.jpg) <style>.button-flexbox-approach { display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; -webkit-appearance: none; border-radius: 0; border-style: solid; border-width: 0; cursor: pointer; font-weight: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0 20px 0 0; position: relative; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; padding: 1.5rem 2rem; font-size: 16px; background-color: #34495e; color: #fff; } .button-flexbox-approach:hover { color: #fff;} .flex-button-container { display: inline-flex; }</style> \n\n<div class=\"flex-button-container\">[A Button](#) [A Button](#) [asdf yjyj](#)</div>\n\n<div class=\"flex-button-container\">[A Button that breaks to two lines](#)</div>\n\nNote that if you have varying heights, you may want to add `align-self` to the buttons so they retain their natural height (`align-self: center` in this example, flex-start to align to the top).\n\n<div class=\"flex-button-container\">[A Button](#) [A Button that breaks to two lines](#)</div>\n\nThis approach just requires that your buttons have a container that is `display: inline-flex;`.

Both of them are a little bit shit.\n\n## Option 1: Padding for vertical centering (Blue Pill)\n\n<style>.button-padding-approach { font-size: inherit; -webkit-appearance: none; border-radius: 0; border-style: solid; border-width: 0; cursor: pointer; font-weight: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0; position: relative; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; display: inline-block; padding: 1rem 2rem 1.0625rem 2rem; font-size: 16px; background-color: #999; color: #000; max-width: 125px; }</style>\n\n<div>[A Button](#) [A Button that breaks to two lines](#)</div>\n\nThis approach works okay, and it's good for multi-line (buttons where the marketing team sanctioned too much copy) text. The problem with typography, is that glyphs can have descenders (as in y and j) which push the bottom of the bounds down. So if you want to properly vertically center your text you have to baby the padding so much that it becomes too much of a pain in the ass. The padding on the above buttons is `padding: 1rem 2rem 1.0625rem 2rem;`. 5 significant figures for bottom padding? I don't think so.\n\n## Option 2: Line Height for vertical centering (Red Pill)\n\n<style>.button-lineheight-approach { -webkit-appearance: none; border-radius: 0; border-style: solid; border-width: 0; cursor: pointer; font-weight: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0; position: relative; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; display: inline-block; font-size: 16px; background-color: #999; color: #000; max-width: 125px; height: 50px; line-height: 50px; padding: 0 2rem 0; }</style>\n\n<div>[A Button](#) [A Button that breaks to two lines](#)</div>\n\nThis approach is a lot less hands off for the vertical alignment.

I don't think so.\r\n\r\n<h2>Option 2: Line Height for vertical centering (Red Pill)</h2>\r\n\r\n<style>\r\n.button-lineheight-approach {\r\n    -webkit-appearance: none;\r\n    border-radius: 0;\r\n    border-style: solid;\r\n    border-width: 0;\r\n    cursor: pointer;\r\n    font-weight: normal;\r\n    line-height: normal;\r\n    margin: 0;\r\n    position: relative;\r\n    text-align: center;\r\n    text-decoration: none;\r\n    display: inline-block;\r\n    font-size: 16px;\r\n    background-color: #999;\r\n    color: #000;\r\n    max-width: 170px;\r\n    height: 50px;\r\n    line-height: 50px;\r\n    padding: 0 2rem 0;\r\n}\r\n</style>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<a href=\"#\" class=\"button-lineheight-approach\">A Button</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"#\" class=\"button-lineheight-approach\">A Button that breaks to two lines</a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/3stacks/8c705d6b88624d5e164355067c4fd0f7.js\"></script>\r\n\r\nThis approach is a lot less hands on for the vertical alignment.

I don't think so.\n\n<h2>Option 2: Line Height for vertical centering (Red Pill)</h2>\n\n<style>\n.button-lineheight-approach {\n    -webkit-appearance: none;\n    border-radius: 0;\n    border-style: solid;\n    border-width: 0;\n    cursor: pointer;\n    font-weight: normal;\n    line-height: normal;\n    margin: 0;\n    position: relative;\n    text-align: center;\n    text-decoration: none;\n    display: inline-block;\n    font-size: 16px;\n    background-color: #999;\n    color: #000;\n    max-width: 170px;\n    height: 50px;\n    line-height: 50px;\n    padding: 0 2rem 0;\n}\n</style>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"#\" class=\"button-lineheight-approach\">A Button</a>\n\n<a href=\"#\" class=\"button-lineheight-approach\">A Button that breaks to two lines</a>\n</div>\n\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/3stacks/8c705d6b88624d5e164355067c4fd0f7.js\"></script>\n\nThis approach is a lot less hands on for the vertical alignment. You set <code>height: 50px;</code> and <code>line-height: 50px;</code> and voila, perfect vertical alignment.

(`morpheus.wav`)\n\n## Option 1: Padding for vertical centering (Blue Pill)\n\n<style>.button-padding-approach { font-size: inherit; -webkit-appearance: none; border-radius: 0; border-style: solid; border-width: 0; cursor: pointer; font-weight: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0; position: relative; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; display: inline-block; padding: 1rem 2rem 1.0625rem 2rem; font-size: 16px; background-color: #999; color: #000; max-width: 170px; }</style>\n\n<div>[A Button](#) [A Button that breaks to two lines](#)</div>\n\nThis approach works okay, and it's good for multi-line (buttons where the marketing team sanctioned too much copy) text. The problem with typography, is that glyphs can have descenders (as in y and j) which push the bottom of the bounds down. So if you want to properly vertically center your text you have to baby the padding so much that it becomes too much of a pain in the ass. The padding on the above buttons is `padding: 1rem 2rem 1.0625rem 2rem;`. 5 significant figures for bottom padding? I don't think so.\n\n## Option 2: Line Height for vertical centering (Red Pill)\n\n<style>.button-lineheight-approach { -webkit-appearance: none; border-radius: 0; border-style: solid; border-width: 0; cursor: pointer; font-weight: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0; position: relative; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; display: inline-block; font-size: 16px; background-color: #999; color: #000; max-width: 170px; height: 50px; line-height: 50px; padding: 0 2rem 0; }</style>\n\n<div>[A Button](#) [A Button that breaks to two lines](#)</div>\n\nThis approach is a lot less hands on for the vertical alignment. You set `height: 50px;` and `line-height: 50px;` and voila, perfect vertical alignment. Until you need two lines and then it bleeds out of the button because you thought a CTA would never be more than 3 words long. At this point you're forced to either increase the button width, or reduce your font-size and neither are very designer friendly.\n\n## Option 3: Flexbox (dubbed by me as the green pill)\n\n![](http://lukeboyle.com/app/uploads/2017/03/CCblInSUMAA8kxv.jpg) <style>.button-flexbox-approach { display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; -webkit-appearance: none; border-radius: 0; border-style: solid; border-width: 0; cursor: pointer; font-weight: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0; position: relative; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; padding: 1rem 2rem 1.0625rem 2rem; font-size: 16px; background-color: #34495e; border-color: #ab0a6f; color: #fff; } .button-flexbox-approach:hover { color: #fff;} .flex-button-container { display: inline-block; }</style> \n\n<div>\n\n<div class=\"flex-button-container\">[A Button](#)</div>\n\n<div class=\"flex-button-container\" style=\"max-width: 170px;\">[A Button that breaks to two lines](#)</div>\n\n</div>\n\nThe main caveat of this approach is that the button now needs a container. The container doesn't need anything fancy on it, just `display: inline-block;` to allow the content to naturally scale, and if you want to restrict how large the button can be, add `max-width: x;` Other than that, this approach is pretty bullet-proof from my testing and I like it a lot.\n        "},{"post":{"ID":"498","post_author":"1","post_date":"2017-03-09 03:57:17","post_date_gmt":"2017-03-09 03:57:17","post_content":"There are two commonly accepted approaches to making buttons with CSS, but both of them are a little bit shit.\n\nWhat if I told you there was another way?

I don't think so.\n\n<h2>Option 2: Line Height for vertical centering (Red Pill)</h2>\n\n<style>\n.button-lineheight-approach {\n    -webkit-appearance: none;\n    border-radius: 0;\n    border-style: solid;\n    border-width: 0;\n    cursor: pointer;\n    font-weight: normal;\n    line-height: normal;\n    margin: 0;\n    position: relative;\n    text-align: center;\n    text-decoration: none;\n    display: inline-block;\n    font-size: 16px;\n    background-color: #999;\n    color: #000;\n    max-width: 170px;\n    height: 50px;\n    line-height: 50px;\n    padding: 0 2rem 0;\n}\n</style>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"#\" class=\"button-lineheight-approach\">A Button</a>\n\n<a href=\"#\" class=\"button-lineheight-approach\">A Button that breaks to two lines</a>\n</div>\n\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/3stacks/8c705d6b88624d5e164355067c4fd0f7.js\"></script>\n\nThis approach is a lot less hands on for the vertical alignment. You set <code>height: 50px;</code> and <code>line-height: 50px;</code> and voila, perfect vertical alignment. Until you need two lines and then it bleeds out of the button because you thought a CTA would never be more than 3 words long.

(`morpheus.wav`)\n\n## Option 1: Padding for vertical centering (Blue Pill)\n\n<style>.button-padding-approach { font-size: inherit; -webkit-appearance: none; border-radius: 0; border-style: solid; border-width: 0; cursor: pointer; font-weight: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0; position: relative; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; display: inline-block; padding: 1rem 2rem 1.0625rem 2rem; font-size: 16px; background-color: #999; color: #000; max-width: 170px; } .unbalanced { padding: 1rem 2rem !important; }</style>\n\n<div>[A Button](#) [asd yjy](#) [A Button that breaks to two lines](#)</div>\n\nThis approach works okay, and it's good for multi-line (buttons where the marketing team sanctioned too much copy) text. The problem with typography, is that glyphs can have descenders (as in y and j) which push the bottom of the bounds down. So if you want to properly vertically center your text you have to baby the padding so much that it becomes too much of a pain in the ass. The padding on the above buttons is `padding: 1rem 2rem 1.0625rem 2rem;`. 5 significant figures for bottom padding? I don't think so.\n\n## Option 2: Line Height for vertical centering (Red Pill)\n\n<style>.button-lineheight-approach { -webkit-appearance: none; border-radius: 0; border-style: solid; border-width: 0; cursor: pointer; font-weight: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0; position: relative; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; display: inline-block; font-size: 16px; background-color: #999; color: #000; max-width: 170px; height: 50px; line-height: 50px; padding: 0 2rem 0; }</style>\n\n<div>[A Button](#) [A Button that breaks to two lines](#)</div>\n\nThis approach is a lot less hands on for the vertical alignment. You set `height: 50px;` and `line-height: 50px;` and voila, perfect vertical alignment. Until you need two lines and then it bleeds out of the button because you thought a CTA would never be more than 3 words long. At this point you're forced to either increase the button width, or reduce your font-size and neither are very designer friendly.\n\n## Option 3: Flexbox (dubbed by me as the green pill)\n\n![](http://lukeboyle.com/app/uploads/2017/03/CCblInSUMAA8kxv.jpg) <style>.button-flexbox-approach { display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; -webkit-appearance: none; border-radius: 0; border-style: solid; border-width: 0; cursor: pointer; font-weight: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0; position: relative; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; padding: 1.5rem 2rem; font-size: 16px; background-color: #34495e; color: #fff; } .button-flexbox-approach:hover { color: #fff;} .flex-button-container { display: inline-block; }</style> \n\n<div>\n\n<div class=\"flex-button-container\">[A Button](#)</div>\n\n<div class=\"flex-button-container\" style=\"max-width: 170px;\">[A Button that breaks to two lines](#)</div>\n\n</div>\n\nThe main caveat of this approach is that the button now needs a container. The container doesn't need anything fancy on it, just `display: inline-block;` to allow the content to naturally scale, and if you want to restrict how large the button can be, add `max-width: x;` Other than that, this approach is pretty bullet-proof from my testing and I like it a lot.\n        "},{"post":{"ID":"506","post_author":"1","post_date":"2017-03-09 04:15:16","post_date_gmt":"2017-03-09 04:15:16","post_content":"There are two commonly accepted approaches to making buttons with CSS, but both of them are a little bit shit.\n\nWhat if I told you there was another way?

This is shown in the second example above, where the button with descenders has equal padding top and bottom. If you want to properly vertically center your text you have to baby the padding so much that it becomes too much of a pain in the ass. The padding on the above buttons is `padding: 1rem 2rem 1.0625rem 2rem;`. 5 significant figures for bottom padding? I don't think so.\n\n## Option 2: Line Height for vertical centering (Red Pill)\n\n<style>.button-lineheight-approach { -webkit-appearance: none; border-radius: 0; border-style: solid; border-width: 0; cursor: pointer; font-weight: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0; position: relative; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; display: inline-block; font-size: 16px; background-color: #999; color: #000; max-width: 170px; height: 50px; line-height: 50px; padding: 0 2rem 0; }</style>\n\n<div>[A Button](#) [A Button that breaks to two lines](#)</div>\n\nThis approach is a lot less hands on for the vertical alignment. You set `height: 50px;` and `line-height: 50px;` and voila, perfect vertical alignment. Until you need two lines and then it bleeds out of the button because you thought a CTA would never be more than 3 words long. At this point you're forced to either increase the button width, or reduce your font-size and neither are very designer friendly.\n\n## Option 3: Flexbox (the secret green pill)\n\n![](http://lukeboyle.com/app/uploads/2017/03/CCblInSUMAA8kxv.jpg) <style>.button-flexbox-approach { display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; -webkit-appearance: none; border-radius: 0; border-style: solid; border-width: 0; cursor: pointer; font-weight: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0; position: relative; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; padding: 1.5rem 2rem; font-size: 16px; background-color: #34495e; color: #fff; } .button-flexbox-approach:hover { color: #fff;} .flex-button-container { display: inline-block; }</style> \n\n<div>\n\n<div class=\"flex-button-container\">[A Button](#)</div>\n\n<div class=\"flex-button-container\">[asdf yjyj](#)</div>\n\n<div class=\"flex-button-container\" style=\"max-width: 170px;\">[A Button that breaks to two lines](#)</div>\n\n</div>\n\nThe main caveat of this approach is that the button now needs a container. The container doesn't need anything fancy on it, just `display: inline-block;` to allow the content to naturally scale, and if you want to restrict how large the button can be, add `max-width: x;` Other than that, this approach is pretty bullet-proof from my testing and I like it a lot.\n        "},{"post":{"ID":"509","post_author":"1","post_date":"2017-03-09 04:37:01","post_date_gmt":"2017-03-09 04:37:01","post_content":"There are two commonly accepted approaches to making buttons with CSS, but both of them are a little bit shit.\n\nWhat if I told you there was another way?

What if I told you there was another way? (`morpheus.wav`)\n\n## Option 1: Padding for vertical centering (Blue Pill)\n\n<style>.button-padding-approach { font-size: inherit; -webkit-appearance: none; border-radius: 0; border-style: solid; border-width: 0; cursor: pointer; font-weight: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0; position: relative; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; display: inline-block; padding: 1rem 2rem 1.0625rem 2rem; font-size: 16px; background-color: #999; color: #000; max-width: 170px; } .unbalanced { padding: 1rem 2rem !important; }</style>\n\n<div>[A Button](#) [asd yjy](#) [A Button that breaks to two lines](#)</div>\n\nThis approach works okay, and it's good for multi-line (buttons where the marketing team sanctioned too much copy) text. The problem with typography, is that glyphs can have descenders (as in y and j) which push the bottom of the bounds down. This is shown in the second example above, where the button with descenders has equal padding top and bottom. If you want to properly vertically center your text you have to baby the padding so much that it becomes too much of a pain in the ass. The padding on the above buttons is `padding: 1rem 2rem 1.0625rem 2rem;`. 5 significant figures for bottom padding? I don't think so.\n\n## Option 2: Line Height for vertical centering (Red Pill)\n\n<style>.button-lineheight-approach { -webkit-appearance: none; border-radius: 0; border-style: solid; border-width: 0; cursor: pointer; font-weight: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0; position: relative; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; display: inline-block; font-size: 16px; background-color: #999; color: #000; max-width: 170px; height: 50px; line-height: 50px; padding: 0 2rem 0; }</style>\n\n<div>[A Button](#) [A Button that breaks to two lines](#)</div>\n\nThis approach is a lot less hands on for the vertical alignment.

This is broken down very nicely on a recent [Smashing Magazine article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/04/start-using-css-custom-properties/#scope-and-inheritance).\n\n### How can CSS Vars help Agander?\n\nI recently wrote a library to ingest variable names and values and spit them onto the root element (see [the package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lukeboyle/sync-vars)) The idea is that each theme would have all relevant variables defined in objects like so:\n\n    const viewState = {\n      currentTheme: 'darkScheme'\n    }\n\n    const themes = {\n      darkSheme = {\n        'primary-color': {\n          hex: '#FFF'\n        }\n      },\n      lightScheme: {\n        'primary-color': {\n          hex: '#000'\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\nAnd then when the currentTheme changes:\n\n    import syncVars from '@lukeboyle/sync-vars';\n\n    function updateCssVariablesWithCurrentScheme(colorScheme) {\n      syncVars(themes[colorScheme]);\n    }\n\n    // if we call that function with 'darkScheme'\n    updateCssVariablesWithCurrentScheme('darkScheme');\n\n    <html style=\"--primary-color: #FFF;\"></html>\n\nSo, how does this help? For one thing, with this approach, I no longer have to worry about adding the colour scheme classes to the body, and I don't have to do any hacky overrides, etc. `_buttons.scss` now looks like this:\n\n    .button {\n      border: 1px solid var(--text-color-var);\n      padding: 6px 5px;\n      background: var(--button-background-color-var);\n      color: var(--text-color-var);\n    }\n\nLooking forward, this approach also means that custom colour themes are very nearly in reach. It also means that colour schemes could be changed on the fly. The user could have a colour swatch tool and be previewing their theme changes live. Taking it even further, it means that the colour schemes no longer need to be a part of the codebase. It could just as easily be a JSON file on the server and changes could be flexibly pushed. Why is this exciting? Say it's Christmas time and you want to get into the spirit of things... ![](http://lukeboyle.com/app/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-27-at-1.31.56-am.jpg) With a few string replacements you have a temporary festive theme to force upon your users.\n\n### Other Applications\n\n#### Accessibility\n\nSites or apps could have buttons to activate color blind mode and specific 'problem' colours could be swapped out for friendly colours. Additionally, high contrast modes would be a breeze.\n\n#### Easter Eggs\n\nUsers could activate alternate modes for websites to get a different experience.\n\n### Retrospective\n\nCSS variables are getting me really excited because it's the first minimal overhead approach to theming in front-end only applications. This is something that will reward well structured stylesheets and result in a better experience for the user. I am looking forward to rolling out custom themes in Agander and finally getting around to making the flat UI theme I have wanted to make for some time.\n        "},{"post":{"ID":"536","post_author":"1","post_date":"2017-05-04 13:26:18","post_date_gmt":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","post_content":"","post_title":"Auto Draft","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"auto-draft","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2017-05-04 13:26:18","post_modified_gmt":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"http://lukeboyle.dev/?p=536","menu_order":"0","post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},"template":"\n            # Auto Draft\n            \n            Posted on 2017-05-04 13:26:18\n            \n            \n        "}]
